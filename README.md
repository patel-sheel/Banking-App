# Banking App
This is a banking program I made using C++. The idea behind the project was to create a tool to show people the value of saving. To do this the program shows how your savings account would look if you save money monthly vs not. The code was required to calculate interest based off a monthly compounding interest rate. Overall I felt I was able to meet the requirements of this project quite well. However, one area where I struggled was getting the calculations to be precise. I ultimately needed to use sites like cplusplus.org and stackoverflow.com for help with getting the numbers to be more precise. Going forward, I think sites like these and effort researching them to find my answers will be what is most helpful to carry on through to my future classes and projects. I also intend to refer back to my projects for code that I can use in my future projects. In order to make doing so easier, my code has comments, object oriented programing, and is written in a clear manner using industry best practices.
